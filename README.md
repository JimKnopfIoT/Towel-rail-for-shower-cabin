# Towel rail for shower cabin
Towel rail for shower cabin. Created with Rhino 6.

Here i have a small project. I designed a towel rail for my shower.
We have had some cheap one's in the past couple of years. Every single one failed somedays
because of unapropriate using force against the tiny wire rod's by pulling towels from it.

That's way i designed my one one and let it build by a small metal construction company.


## Towel Rail V2

The construction consist of a bunch of 12 x 0,3 mm V4A stainless steel pipes, welded together. 
Two suction cups with a build in 4mm M4 screw are mounted on the underside against the glass.

## Towel Rail V3

The construction is similar to V2. The tension struts and intermediary rod have a smaller diameter of 8 mm (instead of 12 mm from V2).

## Towel Rail V4

The construction is similar to V3. Beside the tension struts and intermediary rod, in V4 the front rod has also a diameter of 8mm.
The V4 is easier to build and theirfor it would cost less.
